# About Me

Hello! My name is David, I work primarily with web development and do some
lower-level programming on the side. You can check out my projects on my GitHub
page (I plan to move everything from my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/BraveeSnow)
soon).

If you also work with web development, consider checking out the
[ApocryphaCSS Project](https://github.com/ApocryphaCSS)! It's a classless SCSS
framework made to be modular in design to suit your needs. If you would like to
help develop the framework, feel free to email me.
